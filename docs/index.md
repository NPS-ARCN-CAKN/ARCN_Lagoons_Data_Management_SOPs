# Introduction

This document contains the data management standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the National Park Service, Arctic Inventory and Monitoring Network's Arctic Lagoons Monitoring program. These procedures were developed in 2024 when data management moved from a file-based system to a centralized, authoritative relational database (Microsoft SQL Server). The SOPs presented here are specific to data management and do not supercede any field procedures presented.
